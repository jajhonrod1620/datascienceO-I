It is a large and lucrative market, but many vendors are simply individuals who are renting their own primary residence for short visits. Even larger vendors are typically small businesses with only a small number of places to rent. As a result, they have limited ability to assess large-scale trends and set optimal prices.\n",

Airbnb makes a percentage commission off of the listings, so they are incentivized to help listers price optimally; that is, at the maximum possible point where they will still close a deal.

Notice that this chart covers about a year, but there is a clear discontinuity if you try to \"wrap\" the data (i.e. the difference between the first and last day on this chart is significant). This is caused by an underlying trend of increasing prices every year.

    "\n",
    "In this case, we saw that Airbnb prices are influenced by many factors. Some of the main ones include location, date, number of bedrooms, number of guests, and property type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any future model we build should feature these factors. Incorporating some of these factors, such as the number of bedrooms, should be straightforward, as this has a large and nearly linear relationship to price. But others, such as location, exhibit very non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found some surprising correlations, such as the negative correlation between price and parking. However, after breaking the data down by neighborhoods and incorporating the interaction effect of location, this negative correlation went away entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal effects are a very specific type of interaction effect which must be dealt with separately. Our exploration tells us that any model of AirBnB pricing should take into account strong seasonal components as well as strong spikes around major holidays. "

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "In this case, you learned the following exploration process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by looking at marginal distributions of quantities of interest to look for interesting patterns and/or outliers.\n",
    "2. A correlation matrix can quickly reveal the most promising candidate variables for further investigation.\n",
    "3. Investigate each of these candidate variables in turn. Note which ones exhibit interesting and unexpected correlations.\n",
    "4. Explore potential interaction effects for the variables with unexpected correlations. Suspected important interactions should be looked at directly with further plotting.\n",
    "5. Finally, take some time to carefully plot any interactions that you know to be important from domain knowledge. In our case, we looked at two features that are common to many datasets: location data and temporal data. Both of these contained very important signals that were immediately visually apparent, but which were strongly non-linear and could not easily be reduced to correlations or other simple summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be a bit daunting at first, but it is widely used by veteran data analysts and scientists and is extremely effective in most situations. By iteratively generating hypotheses throughout this process and investigating them, you can uncover great insight about what is going on without building a single formal model. Formal modelling will be discussed in future cases."
